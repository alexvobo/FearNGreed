## Fear and Greed?

Crypto market behavior is very emotional. People get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). People often sell their coins in an irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. 

Powered by the [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), this app tries to save you from emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:

    1. Extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried. That could be a buying opportunity.
     
    2. When Investors are getting too greedy, that means the market is due for a correction.

Therefore, it's useful to analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market based on volatility, volume, social media, dominance, and trends,  and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. 
 - 0 means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed".
